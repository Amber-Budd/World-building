<p>*The ghosts themselves seemed to be the thing that was confusing most people, myself included. 
  I kept changing how I was thinking about them, so hopefully this straightens everything out and clarifies some details.
  There are changes from what I originally wrote in the other two workshops—just ignore what I previously wrote about the ghost types themselves.
  I’ll figure out what all needs to be fixed in the world at large because of this workshop. Without further ado:</p>

<h1>Designing the Ghosts</h1>
<p>There are three states of existence in the world: alive (self-explanatory), proper dead (also self-explanatory), 
  and ghosts (mostly dead). We’re focusing on the ghosts.</p>

<h2>Ghosts In General:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ghosts’ appearance and mental capacity are returned to the optimal state from their physical life.</li>
<li>Possession is an impossibility.</li>
<li>Their personalities remain the same as they were in life.</li>
<li>You only become a ghost if you have a living descendant—thus, there are no child ghosts.</li>
<li>Ghosts are not affected by manmade floors (except in the case of Contact ghosts), 
  but they cannot pass through Earth (dirt, rocks, etc). In the case of tall buildings,
  floors must be made with elements of earth in the construction so that ghosts may ascend higher than the first floor. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of Ghosts</h2>
<p>There are three “types” of ghosts with specific abilities, though people are unable to choose the type they become after death.</p>

<p><b>Definition of Visibility:</b> <br>
	Visibility refers to the ability to see clear details about the ghost’s appearance. 
  Onlookers would be able to recognize the ghost as the living person they once were, though they have a hazy transparency about them. 
<UL><LI>As a mental image, imagine holograms in Star Wars or other sci-fi movies. You can see the person in clear detail,
  but they are obviously not physically present.</LI></UL>
<B>Definition of Audible:</B> <br>
With audibility, none of the scientists and researchers have been able to identify how ghosts
are able to produce sound waves. It is simply a fact of their existence. Sound is limited to just voice – ghosts that are
audible can only make noise by speaking.
</p>

<P>
<b>I. Vapor:</b>
  <ul>
<li>Defining features: visible, incapable of physical interaction, and inaudible (incapable of sound).</li>
<li>Over time, humans and Vapors have developed a hand signal language that allows Vapors some communicative ability to overcome their natural silence. </li>
<li>Vapors are the ghosts that most often request expulsion, but not all do.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>II. Contact (previously Interactive):</b>
  <ul>
<li>Defining features: visible, capable of physical interaction, and audible. </li>
<li>Physical interaction equates to their ability to touch items in the physical world and apply 
  force in varying degrees (according to their subcategories). Manmade walls and floor affect them.</li>
<ul>
<p>
	<b>A. Contact – Propeller:</b>
	<ul>
<li>Unable to pick up items, but can touch and push them.</li>
<i>For example, certain door handles are difficult for them to use, as they cannot turn round knobs but can press on long handles and sliding doors.</i>
	</ul>
</P>
<p>
	<b>B. Contact - Loader:</b>
	<ul>
<li>Through trial and error over the years, it has been realized that this category of ghost can lift any 
  item as long as it is within 21.4 lbs. of weight. Physical dimensions are not a factor.</li>
<i>They would be able to open and close most doors as long as the door did not require a force of over 21.4 lbs. to open. </i>
	</ul>
</p>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>III. Echo:</b>
  <ul>
<li>Defining features: Invisible, incapable of physical interaction, and audible.</li>
<li>The invisible qualities of Echo ghosts have long been researched, and after many years of examination,
  it has been determined that Echoes have a different refraction index than Contacts or Vapors,
  which grants them their “invisibility.” It is not actually true invisibility. </li>
    <ul>
<li>The refraction index of Echoes is the exact same as Earth’s atmosphere—1.0003 at sea level.
  There is more air/atmosphere than the individual ghost, so the ghosts merely appear invisible due to the nature of light refraction. 
  Light bounces off them no differently than air, so they are nearly impossible to see. </li>
<li>In a smokey room, you might be able to see them in some form. In simplest terms, anything that changes 
  the air to give it a different refraction index makes Echoes more visible. Rain does not affect their visibility, 
  since they have no physical body for the rain to bounce off of. </li>
<li>For reference, the refraction index is a ratio. Refraction index: Speed of light in a vacuum / speed of light in a material.</li>
    </ul>
<P>
	<b>A. Echo – Articulate:</b>
    <ul>
<li>Capable of manipulating sound to make full words and sentences. Meaning is generally understood by those who know that ghost’s language. </li>
    </ul>
  </P>
<P>
	<b>B. Echo - Banshee:</b>
    <ul>
<li>These are still audible, but cannot speak in formed words with decipherable meaning. They can use inflection and the like in their sounds,
  but there is no use of a language familiar to the living. </li>
    </ul>

  </ul>
